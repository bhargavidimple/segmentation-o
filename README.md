#Segmentation of Neuronal Structures Using U-Net++
This project involves the segmentation of neuronal structures from electron microscopy (EM) stack images using the U-Net++ architecture, a powerful deep learning model for image segmentation tasks. The project focuses on segmenting neuronal structures in high-resolution 3D electron microscopy data.

#Objective
The goal of this project is to accurately segment various neuronal structures, such as axons, dendrites, and synapses, in 3D EM stacks using the U-Net++ model. U-Net++ is an advanced version of the original U-Net model, which improves segmentation performance by adding dense skip pathways between encoder and decoder layers.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains electron microscopy (EM) stacks of neuronal structures. The dataset is pre-processed and formatted for segmentation tasks, with ground truth masks provided for training.

#Model Architecture
U-Net++ (Nested U-Net): The model architecture is based on U-Net++, which features:
Nested skip pathways: Multiple levels of skip connections between the encoder and decoder to enhance feature propagation.
Deep supervision: Supervision at intermediate layers to improve gradient flow and accelerate learning.
